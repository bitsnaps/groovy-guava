= Groovy Guava

A Groovy wrapper for the Guava toolkit. This project is far from complete, just initiated by
a talk, 'Making Java APIs Groovy' at Groovy and Grails eXchange 2013, London.

All contributions are welcome!

== Building

Clone the project and just execute:

```./gradlew build```

== Examples

Examples can be found in the specification in `src/test`. Note that specifications are supposed to test the wrapper,
not Google Guava itself.
